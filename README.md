Metadata_Injection
==================

A Java program to embed BAM/PFA cataloging data into image files, written by Andrew Chang of BAM/PFA. This program originally extracted cataloging data from the museum's FileMaker database. It is being adapted to use data extracted from CollectionSpace, as part of the migration of the collection management system from FileMaker to CollectionSpace.
